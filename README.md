<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The **LagerManagement Demonstrator** is a demo project designed to showcase the deployment of a web application with a fully separated frontend and backend architecture. The frontend is independently deployed on the web, while the backend is securely hosted to handle data processing and storage.

This demonstrator implements a basic ordering system, where users can place orders and manage inventory. The system is powered by a SQL database that tracks inventory levels, processes orders, and allows for restocking. The project serves as an example of how to structure, deploy, and manage a web application using modern development practices, with a focus on scalability and maintainability.
